Algorithms and data structures for python based codes
1. Array Left Rotation
Name:arrayLeftRotation.py
Complexity: O(1)
Logic:Just take two parts of the array and change their positions

2. Minimum Removals For Making 2 Strings Anagrams
Name: minAnagrams.py
Complexity: O(n)
Logic: Index characters of one string in dictionary and remove them while traversing the other one

3. Verify Binary Tree
Name: verifyBST.py
Complexity: 
Logic: Root is max for left sub tree and it is the minimum value for right subtree
